Hi and welcome to my awesome website! On this page you will find some basic information about myself! 

###Who am I? 

That is great question! 

My name is Andras Balla, I am  a student at [Linneuniversitet](http://lnu.se/?l=en) in Kalmar Sweden.
I am currently studying on the program called [Development and Maintenance of Software](https://coursepress.lnu.se/program/utveckling-och-drift-av-mjukvarusystem/)(swedish link), which is a 3 year program.

I myself live in Halmstad Sweden in a two bedroom apartment with my wife, and doing this program from home by distance learning. On the side i have a part time job.

###What interests me? 

My interests are simple and straight forward:

1. Computers and programming!
    * Because i love building things and building computers and software is cheaper then building a car!
2. Video Games!
    * Well building a powerful computer and letting it gather dust and browsing facebook is just blasphemy!
3. Hiking!
    * I find it relaxing to just pack a backpack and go on a nice long walk in the forest.
