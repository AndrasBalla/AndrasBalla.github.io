Here is a little post about my next outdoors adventure.

Me and the family have decided that we will spend our next vacation on a trip to Sweden´s highest peak Mt. Kebnekaise.

This is a great bonding/adventure you can do as family with an added challenge!

So far we are only in the planing phase which looks something like this. 

First you need to drive about 1.800 km to reach the end of the road at the small village of Nikkaluokta. Here you will park your car and continue on foot.
Then you proceed on a 5 hour hike just about 22 kms to reach the foot of the mountain and the mountain station. Once you reached the station the best idea is to rest either in a tent
or in a room rented at the station. 

The next day you can begin you ascent up the mountain. With a big group this will probably take around 8 hours to go up and down so make sure you bring som food along for the trip.

Once you have done this there some great nature to be seen around the mountain so we will probably stay an extra day and explore the lakes and valley´s in the surrounding area.

This is a trip i highly recommend to anyone since it is not very difficult but it is very beautiful. Or maybe just a trip to Abisko national park which is a bit more easy to access and just 
as beautiful.
