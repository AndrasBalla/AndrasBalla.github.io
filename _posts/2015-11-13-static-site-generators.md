###How to make your own blog ?

There are a lot of ways to build a website some very simple where you can just use a tool that will build it for you all you need to do is to add the information and tweak the looks
 mostly based on the templates they offer. This is usually done with static site generators where they build the skeleton and you just add the information and then it gets built 
 automatically. This is the approach I took except that with help from my teachers and some templates I had to do the skeleton of the site as well. The software to automatically 
 generate the site was Jekyll which is a great tool for building a site that has no real time content and does not require to much online administration.  
 
 I find this method very good and powerful once you jump over the hurdle of setting everything up. You divide up the website into its base components first you write a template to get and idea
 of what you want to build then you create the parts of the website that you want to be same throughout the hole website like the footer, header and head. Then you write different layouts 
 for how you want your site to look like. This is very useful since once you write all that you can now combine those files with your posts in my case and you have your website. It is 
 that simple! Very easy to maintain since you have everything divided up so all you need to do is to tweak in one place and the changes will apply to the hole site where that file is used. 
 For the content you just basically use a loop to include all your blog posts on the desired page very handy and you don´t need to write a new link every time you add a post it just works!
 
 This method is somewhat limited hence the name static site* this will work great for projects that want to provide information to user also blog´s and forums. It works well until you don´t want 
 you site to dynamically change. The site will only change when updated directly.
 
 In short this is great for site´s that want to provide you with information.
