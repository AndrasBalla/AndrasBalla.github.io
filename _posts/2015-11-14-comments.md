### User feedback.

Writing your own blog is all well and good but if you want to be a successful blogger your going to have to take in some user feedback to improve your posts and maybe to just get new ideas.
Because of this is added comments to my site with the help of Disqus. The process is fairly simple there is a detailed install guide at [Disqus](https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/472138-jekyll-installation-instructions)
If you follow the instructions on that page and edit your layout file in my case post.html and you make sure all of your posts use that layout you will have a comment area on all of your posts.
