### Open Graph.

Open Graph turn your webpage into a graph object. This means that when it is linked in a social graph like facebook or slack for example you get a visual representation of the website. 
You can add a picture, video or sound file to be represent your page. You can also add a title description and much more to this social graph. 
It is a great way to present your site with a link. 

The implementation of Open Graph is fairly straight forward. All you need to do is add <meta property> tags with different settings in your <head> section of your html file.

A list of all the settings available to you can be found at [Open Graph](http://ogp.me/).
